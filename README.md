RandomNameGenerator
===================

A basic random name generator.

A compiled version of this program with Windows installer is available here:

This application was written using C# .NET 2.0 and should run on any system that
supports .NET 2.0.  A project is included for Visual Studio 11. It doesn't have any
complicated dependencies, so you can create a project for an earlier version simply
by including the source files.

An installer scripts for the Nullsoft Installer (NSIS) are included, but you'll
probably have to modify the paths in order for it to work.
