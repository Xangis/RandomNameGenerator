# RandomNameGenerator

A basic random name generator for Windows. It was originally released on 
http://zetacentauri.com and was downloaded more than 6000 times before
being open-sourced.

A prebuilt Windows installer is available in the installer directory:

This application was written using C# .NET 2.0 and should run on any system that
supports .NET 2.0.  A project is included for Visual Studio 11. It doesn't have any
complicated dependencies, so you can create a project for an earlier version simply
by including the source files.

An installer script for the Nullsoft Installer (NSIS) are included, but you'll
probably have to modify the paths in order for it to work since they are
specific to my development environment.

## Development Status

I consider this application complete and it is no longer under active
development. I am willing to accept pull requests if you have any
improvements to contribute.
